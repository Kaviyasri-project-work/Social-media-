A Pan American World Airways 747 from Amsterdam was first ordered flown to Beirut, then to Cairo, where it was blown up a few minutes after the passengers and crew were evacuated.  A Swissair DC-8 en route from Zurich , and a TWA 707 en route from Frankfurt were flown to Dawson Field, a landing strip in the Jordanian desert described by the hijackers as the Revolution Airport.A fourth hijacking of an El Al Israel Airlines plane en route to London from Amsterdam was foiled when a security guard aboard the plane killed one of the hijackers and wounded another.  The dead hijacker was Patrick Arguello, a member of the FSLN, a leftist guerrilla movement in Nicaragua.  The wounded hijacker was Leila Khaled, who had participated in the hijacking of a TWA 707 to Syria on August 29, 1969.  Miss Khaled was arrested in London but later released to gain release of the hostages in Jordan.The PFLP announced that the hijackings were in retaliation for American support of Israel and the U.S.  peace initiatives in the Middle East.

The Canadian government rejected the demands but attempted (unsuccessfully) to communicate with the kidnappers.FLQ members kidnapped Pierre LaPorte, minister of labor in the Quebec government.  The kidnappers warned that they would kill LaPorte if the demands made by Cross's kidnappers were not met.  The government again rejected the demands, but offered the kidnappers a safe conduct out of the country if the two hostages were released unharmed.  On October 16, the federal government of Canada invoked emergency powers which authorized police and troops to conduct searches and make arrests without warrants.  On October 18, LaPorte's body was found in the trunk of a car.  In a massive hunt for the kidnappers, more than 500 suspected members and sympathizers of the FLQ were arrested.  Three were later convicted.On December 3, James Cross's kidnappers dropped all of their previous demands and released him unharmed in return for safe conduct to Cuba. On December 28, 1971, LaPorte's kidnappers were arrested.  They were subsequently tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. In December 1978, a French-Canadian couple ended their self-exile in France to face trial in Montreal for the kidnapping of Cross.  They refused to plead to the charges in a preliminary hearing.  The judge entered a plea of not guilty on their behalf.  On August 7, 1979, Jacques and Louise Cossette-Trudel received two-year jail sentences for the kidnapping.  Jacques Lanctot, brother of Louise Cossette-Trudel, was given a longer sentence because he refused to express regret for his actions when he pleaded guilty.On June 9, 1982, Yves Langlois, the last of the five Quebec separatist guerrillas wanted for the kidnapping of James Cross, returned home to Montreal from exile in France.  He pleaded guilty to forcible detention, extortion and conspiracy.

One terrorist was killed by gunfire from the other two, a second was killed by his own grenade, and the third was captured.  The PFLP claimed credit for the attack, saying that the three terrorists belonged to the Squad of the Martyr Patrick Arguello.  Arguello was killed in a l970 hijacking attempt over London (see September 6, 1970 incident).  The PFLP also said that the killings were in retaliation for the shooting of two Arab guerrillas in a hijacking three weeks before, on May 8.According to the PFLP, the three Japanese gunmen had been instructed not to fire on the Air France passengers, but to wait ten minutes for an arriving El Al Israel Airlines flight in order to ensure that 90 to 95 percent of the victims would be Israelis or people with direct loyalties to Israel.  The PFLP said, however, that in any case it did not regard tourists visiting Israel as innocent civilians:  The mere choice of our occupied territory as a place for tourism is in itself a bias in favor of the enemy. The surviving gunman said that the URA had concluded the alliance with the PFLP as a means of thrusting itself on the world stage.Kozo Okamoto was sentenced to life in prison for the attack.

"ISRAEL.   Three Arab guerillas from Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine crossed the border from Lebanon into Israel and first attacked a bus carrying Israeli women on their way home from work. The guerillas killed two of the women and wounded six. They then went to MaÕalot village and killed three more people before seizing a school filled with ninety teenagers who were sleeping in the school following a hike. The guerillas occupied the school, although several students and some teachers (twenty in all) managed to escape by jumping from a window. The guerillas demanded the release of twenty terrorists held in Israeli jails and gave officials until 6 pm to comply, or they threatened to kill the children. They also demanded the French and Romanian ambassadors come to secure the deal. Officials complied and the terrorists held in prison were brought to the school for release. However, negotiations broke down at the last minute and Israeli troops stormed the school. In the ensuing gunfight, all three guerillas were killed. At least twenty-six people were killed and seventy wounded, many of them students.  Officials speculate that it is likely the guerillas stumbled upon the students in the school by chance, since they attacked other targets first and since it was the middle of the night, so they would have no reason to believe students were in the school at that time.  The head of the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the group claiming responsibility for the attack, Nayef Hawatmeh said that the attack had been aimed against the Middle East peace mission of Henry Kissinger, who had been in the Middle East about two months earlier. Hawatmeh said that Kissinger was suggesting a settlement that would mean Ôsurrender of the Palestinian people.Õ The attack was meant to show Kissinger that the Palestinians rejected any proposal that would hurt the Palestinian cause and would accept only the creation of a Palestinian entity. The leader also said the attack was intended to warn the US against turning the West Bank of Jordan over to King Hussein.",terror
